## Main features

### Lightweight, portable and fully open-sourced

Alternatives are either bloated, or not open-sourced, or both. They are a security vulnerability waiting to happen.

Or they require you to install them, and cannot be run in portable mode - leaving a lot of trash files in your PC.

Some even require admin permissions to run (!!).

### Debloats the driver install

![Minimall install feature showcase](TNUC_minimal_install.png)

Stops the NVIDIA spyware from being installed on your computer. You choose EXACTLY which components of the driver you actually want to install.

No bloatware gets installed.

### Flexible Driver Management

Always displays a recommended update, while providing an optional list of older compatible versions. Easily downgrade when facing bugs, or seamlessly switch between Game Ready Drivers (GRD) and Studio (SD) drivers anytime.

## Changes in this fork

- **Multi-connection segmented downloader**: Uses up to 6 parallel range streams with 1 MiB buffers to bypass CDN single-stream throttling and sustain full network download speed.
- **Newer GPU detection & fallback**: Cleanly falls back to modern metadata when device IDs (such as RTX 50-series / `DEV_2DD8`) are not yet present in legacy community data.
- **Optimus / hybrid GPU compatibility**: Added bounded WMI timeouts and null safety to prevent hangs when the dGPU is sleeping in D3Cold.
- **Battery & power safety**: Warns when operating on battery and blocks unattended driver installs when battery is low (≤15%).
- **Laptop-safe minimal install**: Preserves `NVPCF` (Dynamic Boost) and `PPC` (USB-C DisplayPort Alt Mode) by default.
- **CLI & terminal fixes**: Exits cleanly on `--version` and guards `Console.ReadKey` against hangs in non-interactive/redirected shells.
- **Single-file portable build**: Includes official publish profiles producing a standalone ~3.2 MB executable.
