## Main features

### Lightweight, portable and fully open-sourced

Alternatives are either bloated, or not open-sourced, or both. They are a security vulnerability waiting to happen.

Or they require you to install them, and cannot be run in portable mode - leaving a lot of trash files in your PC.

Some even require admin permissions to run (!!).

### Debloats the driver install

![Minimall install feature showcase](TNUC_minimal_install.png)

Stops the NVIDIA spyware from being installed on your computer. You choose EXACTLY which components of the driver you actually want to install.

### Multi Driver Support

Provides an optional list of older compatible versions. Easily downgrade when facing bugs, or switch between Game Ready Drivers (GRD) and Studio (SD) drivers.
